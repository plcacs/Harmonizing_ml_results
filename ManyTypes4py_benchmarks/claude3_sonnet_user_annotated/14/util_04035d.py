        A `torch.FloatTensor` of size (batch, sequence_length)
    average: `str`, optional (default = `"batch"`)
        If "batch", average the loss across the batches. If "token", average

        of losses per batch element.
    label_smoothing : `float`, optional (default = `None`)
        Whether or not to apply label smoothing to the cross-entropy loss.
        For example, with a label smoothing value of 0.2, a 4 class classification
        target would look like `[0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05]` if the 3rd class was
        the correct label.
    gamma : `float`, optional (default = `None`)
        Focal loss[*] focusing parameter `gamma` to reduces the relative loss for
        well-classified examples and put more focus on hard. The greater value
        `gamma` is, the more focus on hard examples.
    alpha : `Union[float, List[float]]`, optional (default = `None`)
        Focal loss[*] weighting factor `alpha` to balance between classes. Can be
        used independently with `gamma`. If a single `float` is provided, it
        is assumed binary case using `alpha` and `1 - alpha` for positive and
        negative respectively. If a list of `float` is provided, with the same
        length as the number of classes, the weights will match the classes.

def combine_tensors(combination: str, tensors: List[torch.Tensor]) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Combines a list of tensors using element-wise operations and concatenation, specified by a
    `combination` string.  The string refers to (1-indexed) positions in the input tensor list,
    and looks like `"1,2,1+2,3-1"`.

    We allow the following kinds of combinations : `x`, `x*y`, `x+y`, `x-y`, and `x/y`,
    where `x` and `y` are positive integers less than or equal to `len(tensors)`.  Each of
    the binary operations is performed elementwise.  You can give as many combinations as you want
    in the `combination` string.  For example, for the input string `"1,2,1*2"`, the result
    would be `[1;2;1*2]`, as you would expect, where `[;]` is concatenation along the last
    dimension.

    If you have a fixed, known way to combine tensors that you use in a model, you should probably
    just use something like `torch.cat([x_tensor, y_tensor, x_tensor * y_tensor])`.  This
    function adds some complexity that is only necessary if you want the specific combination used
    to be `configurable`.

    If you want to do any element-wise operations, the tensors involved in each element-wise
    operation must have the same shape.

    This function also accepts `x` and `y` in place of `1` and `2` in the combination
    string.
