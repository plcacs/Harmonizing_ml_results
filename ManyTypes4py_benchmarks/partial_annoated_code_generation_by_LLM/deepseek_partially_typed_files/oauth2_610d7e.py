class OAuth2PasswordRequestForm:
    """
    This is a dependency class to collect the `username` and `password` as form data
    for an OAuth2 password flow.

    The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be
    collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific
    fields `username` and `password`.

    All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.

    Read more about it in the
    [FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/).
